## Description
This small project is a README generator written in python. I wrote it to teach myself the syntax; I have already completed this project in javascript so I can focus more on learning the language than figuring out how to complete the project. To use, please refer to the Installation and Usage sections below.

## Installation
Obviously, this code runs on python. This means you will need a python interpreter on your machine. You can download this from the official website.

## Usage
To run this code, enter the command 'python prompt.py' in a terminal at the root of this directory. From there, follow the prompts to enter the relevant project information. Once the file is written, you can find it in the dist/ folder of this directory.
